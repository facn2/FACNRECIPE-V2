### checklist of project requirements:   

+ Simple web app with a node server and a database
+ Your database comes with a schema, which should be documented in your readme (along with any other architectural decisions)
+ Database hosted on Heroku, or locally
+ Build script for your database
+ Security concerns appropriately considered (you must protect against script injections!)
+ Good test coverage both server- and client-side
+ Content dynamic, but DOM manipulation kept to a minimum
+ Mobile-first design
+ Clear user journey (even if you take one of our suggested ideas, document the user journey in your readme)

### Stretch goals
+ Function for adding recipes to database
+ Function for editing/deleting recipes
+ Implement authentication for admins to edit/delete posts(recipe)  

### Rules
+ All branches should be understood and reviewed by all team members prior to pushing/merging to master
